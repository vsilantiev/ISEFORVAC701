  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

  Number of occupied Slices:                 2,025 out of  33,650    6%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        7,512
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,683 out of   7,512   22%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 573 out of   7,512    7%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       5,256 out of   7,512   69%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 269,200    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 2

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

WARNING:Bitgen:343 - This design contains pins which have locations (LOC) that
   are not user-assigned or I/O Standards (IOSTANDARD) that are not
   user-assigned.  This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the
   board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in
   extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is
   connected.  To prevent this warning, it is highly suggested to specify all
   pin locations and I/O standards to avoid potential contention or conflicts
   and allow proper bitstream creation.
